==================
 Admin Operations
==================

An admin API request will be done on a URI that starts with the configurable 'admin'
resource entry point. Authorization for the admin API duplicates the S3 authorization
mechanism. Some operations require that the user holds special administrative capabilities.
The response entity type (XML or JSON) may be specified as the 'format' option in the
request and defaults to JSON if not specified.

Get Usage

Create Key
==========

Create a new key. If a ``subuser`` is specified then by default created keys
will be swift type. If only one of ``access-key`` or ``secret-key`` is provided the

then it will be modified. The response is a container listing all keys of the same
type as the key created. Note that when creating a swift key, specifying the option
``access-key`` will have no effect. Additionally, only one swift key may be held by
each user or subuser.
